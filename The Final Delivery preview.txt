 In this preview for my soundscape narrative, titled The Final Delivery, I show the first scene in the story. There is a total of three scenes in the whole narrative. The Final Delivery tells the story of a pizza delivery girl, who is nearing the end of her shift and just wants to go home, but she gets one last delivery to complete before her shift ends. She reluctantly delivers the pizza, but then things turn sour for her…
The first scene takes place in the pizza shop when she receives the last delivery of her shift. The pizza restaurant is still lively; people are talking and having a good time, serene music is being played, and of course, pizzas are being made. The protagonist wants to get her final delivery over with so she can officially end her shift. As she leaves the pizza restaurant, the narrative transitions to the second scene.
The first scene is the only part I have done so far, but the second scene shows her getting into her car, and her car ride on the way to the house to make the delivery. The final scene is when she arrives at the consumers house, ready to make the delivery. At the door, she greets a seemingly innocent old woman, who says that she ordered this pizza because it was her husbands favorite meal to share with her, who is now dead. Due to this, the old woman invites the delivery driver inside to eat the pizza with her, but things aren’t quite as innocent as they seem, which the delivery driver will soon find out.
The questions I could ask for the listeners tuning in so far are these:
Were you able to tell what is going on and follow the plot/narrative?
What are good things about the preview, and what would you change about it?
Considering the voice for the man telling the protagonist she has a delivery to complete, do you think I should find a person with an actual deep voice, or is my distorted voice okay?
What do you think of the remainder of the plot?
Do you have any advice for me overall?
Thanks for listening!
